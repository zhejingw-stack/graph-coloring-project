# Graph Coloring Project

This project implements and compares several graph coloring algorithms, including:

- Greedy Coloring
- Welsh-Powell Algorithm
- DSatur Algorithm
- Exact Backtracking (for small graphs)

The program evaluates each algorithm based on:
- Number of colors used
- Runtime performance
- Gap to optimal solution (when available)

## How to Run

```bash
python graph_coloring_project_full_v3.py
